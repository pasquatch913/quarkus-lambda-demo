can deploy by running the below:

1. `mvn clean install -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -DskipTests`
2. overwrite target/sam.native.yaml file that is generated by install with one from the root directory
3. `sam deploy -t target/sam.native.yaml -g --profile personal`

TODO:
can't run ITs on native image locally because the standard build is for linux architecture, not macos need to determine
a way to run locally

info image size around 22 Mb vs ~16MB for existing lambdas

build time is much slower, probably ~4 min vs ~1 min

cold start time and normal execution is much faster cold start ~400ms vs several seconds for standard lambda
